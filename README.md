This is not a complete course in Linux but just an introduction for program students at [Linnaeus University](www.lnu.se), Kalmar, Sweden

** All video recording will be in Swedish **

This content is concentrated to server versions of the Ubuntu distributions.

## Goal
The student should get an understanding of the Linux system and its characteristics. The student will also get some experience in using bash commands, text editors and bash scripting.

## Introduction to Bash scripting
  To come...

### Resources for bash
  The net is full of different pages about bash scripting. A good start is the three links below. Since you all know about programming; what a selection statement and a loop is for example we are more into studying the syntax. Especially the "part 1" and "part 2" is good for this. The third part have some good examples of bash scripts though. Start by reading these guides.
* Bash programming tutorial from developer
  * [Part 1](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bash/)
  * [Part 2](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bash2/)
  * [Part 3](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bash3/)


 There is much more to learn if you want. Here are some extra resources. It could also come in handy to have a reference page when you have to look up stuff.
  * [Bash Reference Manual](http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/bash/bashref.html) <- for references use
  * [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html)

  * [Bash programming introduction (from 2000)](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)
  * [Advanced Bash Scripting Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
  * [Collection of Bash Examples](http://www.fifi.org/doc/bash/examples/)
