## Bash Exercises

This is just a few ideas for handy scripts that could be done as exercises for getting more experience in bash scripting.

1. **Archiving script** - Write a script that take two paths as parameter. Everyting under the first path should be compressed and saved to the second path. The compressed file should have a timestamp as a name.


```bash
# compress everything under ~/doc and put the compressed file in ~/archive
./archiving.sh ~/doc ~/archive
```
